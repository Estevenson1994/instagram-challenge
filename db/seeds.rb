# This file should contain all the record creation needed to 
# seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed 
# command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# 
User.create([{ email: 'test@test.com', 
               password: 'testtest', 
               user_name: 'test', 
               first_name: 'test', 
               last_name: 'test' 
             }])
